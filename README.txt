There are four folders for R2 analysis.
The "RNA-seq" folder contains the RNA-seq analysis pipeline.
The "CRIT-Seq" folder contains the CRIT-Seq analysis pipeline for detecting off-target events caused by R2Tg integration.
The "third-generation" folder is used to analyze gene integration by third-generation sequencing.
The "amplicon-seq" contains the indel analysis pipeline.
The "reference_sequence" folder contains all reference sequences except T2T.
